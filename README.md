# Stable Dreamfusion Pure Torch

This repository contains a pure PyTorch implementation of the Stable Dreamfusion model. The implementation is divided into several components for better organization and maintainability.

## Directory Structure

stable-dreamfusion/
├── README.md
├── main.py
├── setup/
│ └── install_dependencies.sh
├── config/
│ └── training_config.py
├── utils/
│ └── helpers.py
└── training/
└── train.py

This structure organizes the code into logical components, making it easier to maintain and extend. You can adjust the specific contents of each file as needed based on the detailed logic and functionality of your original script.


- `README.md`: This file. Contains information about the project and instructions for setup and usage.
- `main.py`: The main script that initiates the training process.
- `setup/install_dependencies.sh`: A shell script to install necessary dependencies.
- `config/training_config.py`: Configuration file for training parameters.
- `utils/helpers.py`: Utility functions used in the project.
- `training/train.py`: Contains the main training logic.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stable-dreamfusion.git
    cd stable-dreamfusion
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bash setup/install_dependencies.sh
    ```


## Usage

1. Configure training parameters in `config/training_config.py`.
2. Run the main script to start training:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```



Output
The training results will be saved in the directory specified by the Workspace parameter.
